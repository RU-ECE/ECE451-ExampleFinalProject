# ECE451-ExampleFinalProject

This example shows the structure and requirements of your project

## Structure

* Create a private repo. Note, this one is public so you can all see it
* Share with me and the grader

We want to see the following directory structure

* doc/: contains the documentation, including
  * proposal: 1-2 pages of text, max. Supporting diagrams and images may take more
  * presentation: your final presentation will be placed here.
    * Slides required.
    * Handout is a good idea so you don't have to say everything. Think of it as a cheatsheet for your presentation viewers
* src/: all code goes in here
  * Your code should have a clean way to build (make, cmake, cargo)
  * Code should be clean and neat
    * Everything should be in the main branch of the repo
    * dead code should be deleted (you can have alternate versions in a different branch)
    * Code should be commented. Comments should describe what the code does, not explain the language
    * variable names should be meaningful. i,j,k are fine for loops
  * README on top level should describe how to build the code
  * A single command should ideally build the program. If it's cmake, then perhaps 2 commands
* README
  * Instructions on how to build and run the project
* ref/ any supporting documentation. You don't need to copy huge manuals but
  * Any papers you read on the subject of your final project can go here

## Rubric

* Effort: 30% of the grade is in weekly work on your repo. Each week your project git activity will be logged. No activity = 0 for that week
* Difficulty level: The complexity of the problem will be used to handicap your project. If you tackle something really hard, you may not succeed.
  However it is easier to give an A to success. Please try to make something work.
* Implementation: 50%
  * Does the code work?
  * Does your presentation present clear results based on this work?
* Initial proposal: 2% (can be corrected after initial review)
  * Clear prject goals
  * Clearly stated milestones and timelines
  * Project team assigned
  * Responsibilities of each team member clearly defined in writing
  * Testing does not have to be specified in detail yet, but you are committing to demonstrating
    * that your project works
    * how fast it works compared to single threaded code (because this is a parallel class)
* Presentation 18%
  * Clarity of problem statement
  * Clarity of project work
    * It should be clear what you did, and what did not work. It's better to be honest
  * Handling questions
    * Are you able to handle questions about your project?
